* Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).
* Focus on the following:
  * Major differences
  * Major similiarities
  * Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
  * Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?

This is my first year teaching AP Computer Science A, so I'm learning while teaching. I adopted the CS Awesome Curriculum. Over the summer, I was debating between three CS Curriculums: CS Awesome, CodeHS, and Code.org. I chose CS Awesome because it could be embedded in the online IDE, Coding Rooms. I think it is nice to keep the interactive lessons and the IDE together so students have one less website they have to keep track of.  I just finished Unit 1 Primative Types this week. I really like that the CS Awesome curriculum includes a lot of real life analogies in the curriculum. For example, in the lesson where we disscused about variables and data types, CS Awesome Curriculum compared int, double to Starbucks coffee sizes. I think it is a really nice way/visual to help students understand why we could fit an int in a double, but we can't store a double in an int. CS Awesome Curriculum also uses a lot of physical models in helping students understand the concepts. 

Both CS Awesome and CodeHS are fully aligned to the College Board AP CS A course standards. Both curriculums focused on problem solving and algorithm developent. However, in comparison to CS Awesome Curriculum, I think the coding exercises in CodeHS are more interesting and challenging. I would definitely adopte/incorporate some of the programming exercise from CodeHS into my class. I think the programming exercises in CodeHS are more relevant to students. For example, in the Unit 1 User Input lesson,  CodeHS included a programming exercise where students have to create a MLA citation generator. I think this is a great programming exercise because students can actually use it in their English classes. CS Awesome foucsed more on AP Test Prep. There are AP Multiple Choice Practice questions in almost every lesson. CodeHS has mini quiz for each lesson.
