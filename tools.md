## Coding Rooms 
Coding Rooms is an online platform for teaching programming. The platform provides teachers with a dashboard view of students' work, letting them access students' code in real time. I picked Coding Rooms as the classroom IDE becasue Coding Rooms was built to address the needs of Computer Science teachers. From student engagement tools to gradebook exports, Coding Rooms provides more robust and teacher-oriented usability’s. Coding Rooms provides video, audio, and chat conferencing in addition to the live coding environment. In my AP CSA class, I'm using Coding Rooms for building interactive lessons, providing coding practices, collecting work/assignments and classroom management. I really like the activity monitor feature on Coding Rooms. I can track student involvement and check students' codes in real time and pinpoint which kids require the most attention. Like other online IDEs, Coding Rooms has the collaborative editing feature that allows the teacher and students to work collaboratively in small groups or as a class. Coding Room also has live classroom moderation, including presentation pad access control. With the presentation feature, students will be able to see the teacher’s presentation on their own screen and code along. I have also noticed that during presentation mode, students are locked into the page/assignment when the teacher is presenting. They can't work on any other coding assignments during the presentation.
