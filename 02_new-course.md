Come up with an idea for a new comptuer science course that you would teach at your current school.
Make sure to include the following:
General description of the course
Target audiance
Where it fits along with the other courses in your school

In my school, we are currently offering the following computer science courses: 
* Computer Science Discoveries: This is a half year course offered to 9th and 10th graders. This is an introductory computer science course. This course covers topics such as programming, physical computing, HTML/CSS, and data. Through the course, students will build their own websites, apps, games, and physical computing devices using code.org's cutting-edge AppLab and GameLab, and Adafruit's Circuit Playground. 
* App Development: This is a full year course offered to 9th and 10th graders. In this course, students learn how to use Swift to build a fully functioning app of their own. 
* AP Computer Science A (Grades 10-12)
* AP Computer Science Principle (Grades 9-12)

We do not have a computer science course sequence in our school. I teach AP Computer Science A, and AP CSA counts as a Math elective for students. While AP Computer Science Principle is a technology elective. 

I would like to add a course before AP CSA or AP CSP. The Computer Science Discoveries we have right now does not equip students with the skills they need for AP CSA or AP CSP. 

Sequence: Computer Science Discoveries &rarr; Intro to Computer Science Programming &rarr; AP CSA / AP CSP 

New Course: Intro to Computer Science Programming
This course is an introduction to programming. This will be a full year course, and will be open to students in grade 10-12. 
Students will take this course before they take AP Computer Science A. Students are introduced to computer programming concepts, such as loop structures, conditional statements and arrays. Object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, abstract classes and interfaces will be introduced. Students will also delve into web applications by writing applets.
