## Snap! 

### What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
AP Computer Science Principle, Grades 9 - 12
Most students do not have prior coding experience. Some students, who have taken Intro to CS discoveries in their freshmen year, were exposed to basic HTML/CSS. Some students used Scratch in middle school. 

### What is the language?
Snap! 

### How does one write & run code in this language?
To write codes, students will snap together puzzle pieces that each contain one component of the code instructions. 

### Rate the complexity of the syntax?
Snap! is a block-based programming language. Syntax and simulation are very straight forward and easy to understand.  

### Strengths? How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
- Snap! combines Ssratch with Scheme. 
- Snap! is a web based. Students do not need to download anything. 
- Snap! is a block-based programming language. Students will not need to type out each command line by line, they just need to snap together puzzle pieces that contain the code instructions. Snapping blocks together helps prevent many syntax error, which could be very frustrating and intimidating for young kids learning programming the first time. By eliminating the possibility of these syntax errors, students will be able to focus on the logic of their codes. 
- It also makes the implementation of logic very intuitive. 
- Students can create their own C-shaped blocks, as well as functions. This provides students with a lot more flexibility and freedom when creating their projects. 

### Weaknesses? How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
- It does not offer a progression to text-based programming. 

### Why did you select this language for this class?
I chose this language for AP CSP because of the simplicity of blocked-based programming language. It makes coding easier. It is user friendly for students who have no prior coding experiences, and they can focuse on the logic of their codes and does not need to learn difficult concepts which the high-level programming languages require. Students can quickly learn how to run programs and unleash their creativity.
